## Code

Data processing and analysis steps are contained within `code/run.sh`. Although file extension corresponds to a shell script, it is *not* recommended that this file be executed -- it contains bits of code that are optional, and also describes code that needs to be run on a cluster. The script is therefore meant to be a guide on the processing steps used to generate the results in the paper, and each step within should be executed sequentially instead, with output manually scrutinized.
